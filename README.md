# Unzpack

> Persist ZIP content bytes into a file and extract it into a specific directory on file system.

**Unzpack** is just a helper which persists ZIP bytes content on file system, then extract its content into a specific directory path and finally deletes current ZIP file.

For example, it can be useful when ZIP content is provided via [include_bytes!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html) macro.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
unzpack = "0.1"
```

```rust
use unzpack::Unzpack;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    Unzpack::unpack(include_bytes!("../dist/public.zip"), "./assets.zip", "./dist")?;

    Ok(())
}
```
