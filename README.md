> A library to persist ZIP content bytes into a file and extract its content on file system.

**Unzpack** is just a helper which persists ZIP bytes content on file system, then extract its content into a specific directory path and finally deletes current ZIP file.

For example, it can be useful when ZIP content is provided via [include_bytes!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html) macro.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
unzpack = "0.1"
```

```rust
use unzpack::Unzpack;

const BYTES: &[u8] = include_bytes!("data/assets.zip");

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    Unzpack::unpack(
        BYTES,              // Zip bytes
        "./out-file.zip",   // Output Zip file 
        "./out-dir",        // Output extraction directory 
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```
